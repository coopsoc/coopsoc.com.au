My familiarity with the current executives and board of directors will enable the smoothest of transitions so our new team members, including the subcommittee, have the resources and support they need to push Co-op Society to new heights this year.

My work ethic is unparalleled, I am reliable and have a keen eye for detail - crucial skills for a co-pres. I produce tangible results, having played a major role in organising last year‚Äôs exec roadtrip and first year camp earlier this year.

While I would love to see first years take on executive and director positions, I do believe the role of Co-President requires a degree of experience, which I possess as I have held 5 different positions in 3 different societies in the past year.

My vision for Co-opSoc is to get back on track with fun events to make the Co-op community tighter than ever before!`,

The COOP community is an integral part of being a COOP, and to many people, it's comparable to value of the program itself! I hope to give COOPSoc the attention that it needs and deserves, and through COOPSoc, I hope to enrich your experiences as COOPs so that university becomes the highlight of your life!

My journey with COOPSoc began as a first-year representative. Working alongside the incredibly swag Doris, I witnessed the 2023 exec team work their roles to perfection. 
This year, as the Technical Vice President at CSESoc, I‚Äôve been privy to the inner workings of a large society, learning how to maintain quality and consistency. These roles have not only prepared me for the logistical challenges of leadership but have also instilled in me a profound appreciation for the dynamics of a smaller, close-knit community like COOPSoc.

My vision for COOPSoc in 2024 is twofold: to amplify the fun, memorable experiences that epitomise the complete university journey, and to enhance our society's professional standing.

My primary vision is to deliver fun experiences with a quality that parallels that of the best societies - only enhanced by the presence of you legends. That is, I hope to run accessible and fun events that bring people together and help form lifelong memories!

Some events I want to see the most:
COOPSoc Christmas In July Meriton (with Secret Santa) (üòÇ) + Halloween party in October (costume party type beat) (üòÇ).
COOPSoc Pubcrawl (Soda Factory to Scary Canary to 80 Proof to WAO) (üòÇ).
COOPSoc Vivid (üòä).
COOPSoc Paint and Sip (üòç).

An auxiliary vision of mine is to improve COOPSoc‚Äôs professional standing to make COOPSocs importance as a society concrete, and (stretch goal!) potentially increase COOPSoc‚Äôs funding from the COOP Office. 
As you may or may not know, due to our affiliation with official COOP sponsors, COOPSoc is not able to obtain sponsors. 
Therefore, it should be in COOPSoc‚Äôs best interest to cement our social and professional value! Not only so that we can uphold the legacy of COOPSoc and encourage following years to do the same, but also so that we can beg the COOP office for more money!

Some initiatives in this regard include:
COOPSoc Investing and Personal Finance Workshop (so you can hit 6 fig NW asap).
Reviving COOPSoc Linkedin. 
Making COOPSoc Marketing more concrete (Proper pictures of events, more active in general). 
COOPSoc Interyear networking event, including COOPs who have already graduated (Potential collaboration with the COOP office). 

Let's work together to restore COOPSoc to it's former glory, and help it find new heights!

All the best everyone!

Two things that matter to me are 1) 2024 Co-ops are a super close-knit community and 2) We have incredible, memorable events. How will we achieve these goals? By electing me as Treasurer, I will organise more funding into the events that YOU really want and will enjoy, including but not limited to, more ice skating and pub crawls.

  //         description: `Why does Co-op soc exist? Well, we say it ourselves on our website: At the core of the society, our aims are to socialise and meet new people. In fact ‚Äì I‚Äôm Lucas ‚Äì and I‚Äôve been helping build that website as a member of your IT Subcommittee throughout 2023 and I'd love to step up into the role of your IT director.

  // I‚Äôve met some wonderful people on this subcom, and being able to socialise with other co-ops, across years, degrees and experiences has brought a great sense of community. It would be my priority to cultivate that environment as a director, especially as we build friendships with new and returning scholars.

  // Of course, beyond this environment of friendship and collaboration, I‚Äôm confident that I can lead our team to innovate on the online systems that Co-op Soc maintains ‚Äì after all this is the heart of our publications, supports our charity, and the all-important merch store. We‚Äôre actually planning something exciting: development of a new online platform for Co-op students to organise meetups, study groups and events on campus.

  // This year has been an enormous learning experience for me, and I cannot wait to assist our next generation in learning valuable skills in front-end web development as well as teamwork in the IT field.

  // Ideally, I'd be suited for an IT Technical Director role, bringing my technical expertise from outside projects, complementing Nick in an IT Project Management role.

  // I hope to get your vote, and I look forward to meeting the Co-op Soc of 2024. Thanks!`,
