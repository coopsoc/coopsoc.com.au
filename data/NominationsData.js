When first joining Co-op Society, on that very first camp, I went in with no expectations and close to no friends at UNSW. However, by the bus ride there that had all changed, meeting wonderful people who are now close friends and finding a passion for the society. It is this combination of passion for the friends I've met and the opportunity to facilitate this same experience for next years co-ops that has lead me to run for the position of Co-president. I am prepared to put in the time and commitment that this task requires, understanding that this is not just an item for a resume but a genuine commitment to the society. At the end of the day I would love to be a part of this thriving society filled with some of the most amazing people I know :)) Your consideration would be much apricated! 🌱🌱"

I'm grateful to have crossed paths with each one of you. It has been a privilege to work for such extraordinary people, & I hope to enrich the experience of all COOPs in 24` as co-president. My mission is to empower directors & subcom to fulfil their personal visions in order to contribute to the greater vision of the society. I’ll fulfil this by actively handling administrative, higher-level descisions, & serving as a reliable source of help. Handling these responsibilities & associated stress will help our team deliver meaningful, high-quality events. I'm well-prepared for this due to my current role on the COOPSoc exec team, where I've gained expertise in the systems & frameworks that facilitate the society’s operation. Ultimately, I hope to see COOPSoc as welcoming second home for both current & new scholars. Ty guys <3"

Specifically, I want to update the website to make it relevant to current students, starting with updating the publications page, which is 3 years out of date. I'll work with the Pubs Director to develop more content for the website, like an improved 1st yr guide, more educational articles etc. Also, the Coop newsletter is currently email-only, causing it to get lost in the sea of admin. There's a simple fix - host the articles on the Co-op website!

I'll also work with Lucas to reduce bugs in the merch system. We've worked with it over the past year, so know the issues and how to fix them. For example, fixing discount codes so they're consistently applied. Check out more of my ideas here: https://github.com/coopsoc/coopsoc.com.au/issues/created_by/scorpiontornado. I have suggestions for new projects too, like a tool for meeting people on campus.

My big-picture vision is suited to an IT Project Manager role, which would compliment Lucas' Technical Director role. Also, my democratic leadership style suits an intelligent group like coop, and would free up the cognitive load of the Technical Director - allowing them to make better-informed decisions surrounding IT technologies.

With your vote, I will make these ideas a reality! Thank you :)`

I am a Doris and Alex certified accountant who will make sure we adhere to all standards (while sneaking some extra money from Arc). What more can I say?

I’ve met some wonderful people on this subcom, and being able to socialise with other co-ops, across years, degrees and experiences has brought a great sense of community. It would be my priority to cultivate that environment as a director, especially as we build friendships with new and returning scholars.

Of course, beyond this environment of friendship and collaboration, I’m confident that I can lead our team to innovate on the online systems that Co-op Soc maintains – after all this is the heart of our publications, supports our charity, and the all-important merch store. We’re actually planning something exciting: development of a new online platform for Co-op students to organise meetups, study groups and events on campus.

This year has been an enormous learning experience for me, and I cannot wait to assist our next generation in learning valuable skills in front-end web development as well as teamwork in the IT field.

Ideally, I'd be suited for an IT Technical Director role, bringing my technical expertise from outside projects, complementing Nick in an IT Project Management role.
